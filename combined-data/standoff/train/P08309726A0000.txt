To gain further insight into the pathogenesis of the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the authors studied possible relationships among the activation status of circulating polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), cytokine levels, and the severity of lung injury in 31 patients: 15 with ARDS, 9 with severe pneumonia uncomplicated by ARDS, and 7 mechanically ventilated patients with neither ARDS nor pneumonia.
